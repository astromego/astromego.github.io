        <h1>Alchemy 101</h1>

    <p>Second project for my IXD301 module. We have to teach selected elements of the periodic table to kids or undergrads. I wanted to do the ultimate throwback and teach them about metals through alchemy. </p>

    <h2>Alchemical Research</h2>
    <p>I wanted to create interesting visuals that would hold kids attention so they wouldn't be bored but not fully distract them from what was being taught so I started designing some transmutation circles.</p>

     <p>I wanted everything to be dark with spots of light, for a combination of reasons. Alchemists were keen to use light in their experiments, as they thought it was a spirit trapped in matter. It's equal parts magical and futuristic. I think the further away from a chemistry textbook I get, the better.</p>
    <br>
     <p>The transmutation circles were designed from simple shapes, primarily circles, triangles and hexagons. I did also use the symbols for the sun and the moon, which are very important in alchemy. </p>
